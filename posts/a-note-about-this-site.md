First of all, thank you for stopping by and taking an interest in what I'm up to!

I put this site together quickly with the intention of writing something that's both easy to update and relatively lightweight. I've previously used WordPress and other solutions that ultimately felt like they were more than what I needed to share project updates.

This site was built using Michel Forton's [php-markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown) project[^1]. All posts are parsed from markdown into articles that are displayed based on link structure. *.md files are stored in the '/posts' directory, making pushing new updates easy.

I also have the post ordering on the site set such that the last modified post will appear first. I believe this to be best as projects are always evolving. If this were a journal that needed edited later, retaining a published date, I would consider doing something different. Hell, I might do that eventually as this site is also an evolving project. You can grab the latest version and use it as you please from my [GitHub page.](https://github.com/wesleysinks/simple-markdown-blog)
